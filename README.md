# shadow-effect-simulation
This is a project to simulate the effect of shadow

The objective is to know the shadow effect of diameter and latitude on radiation. I'm going to compare latitudes 25, 35, 45 and diameter of 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 m. 
The y axis will be percentage of of radiation. Lower percentage means more radiation is blocked due to the shadow effect.  

Note that the height between manure surface and tank wall is fixed (2m)

I changed my mind, now the y axis is the total solar radiation to the manure surface (W/m2)
